This folder contains the sql scripts for MySQL to setup the
database. The sql scripts contain the snapshot of the server
database as on 22 Sept 2013.

You can also use the fixtures in PROJECT_ROOT/rost/fixtures
to load the values into the database by using 
'python manage.py loaddata' command.

-----------------------------------------------------------

These sql scripts will make four tables in your database :
1. rost_route - Contains route information.
2. rost_stage - Contains stage information.
3. rost_stage_routes - Contains the info about buses from a
                       particular stage.
4. rost_stageseq - Contains the sequence of stages in a route.


------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE - Use these scripts after installing django and syncdb
       command.
